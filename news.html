                <ul>
                    <li>The site has gotten a bit of a makeover! Rather than have one page for everything, there are now individual pages for the services. This way, we can have screenshots and more detailed info about each service.</li>
                    <li>The Public Beta is OUT! Wii Room is now available to all in the form of a beta. This means that not everything is present as of now but we'll add more features in the future. To get it, check out the Guide!</li>
                    <li>Thanks to everyone who was part of the launch event on the 5th! We had an awesome time in our Discord!</li>
                    <li>RIGHT NOW: Special CMOC contest! We're doing a collaboration with RiiConnect24 to do a special contest in Check Mii Out Channel. The goal: make a Mii of our mascot, Digi! The contest starts today, so be sure to check it out, and maybe participate in it yourself!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thanks for reading, see you next time for another news report!</p>

                    <li>Mascot - In case you haven't been following our Twitter,  we're here to say that we have a mascot - Digi! He'll be used throughout promotional material, and we have emojis of him in our Discord. He also has a Twitter of his own, which you can see right here. </li>
                    <li>Ask us stuff! If you're in our Discord, we have a new channel called #wl24-ama, where you can ask us questions about the service. Don't be afraid to ask anything!</li>
